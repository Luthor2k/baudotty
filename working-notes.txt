*raw clock signal is 100MHz

with N = 6, i_clock = 1563 kHz
want 9600 baud,
1563khz / 9.6khz = 162.8125 clocks per bit
output looks like crap

N = 6 and clks per bit = 256 fine at 6098 baud
N = 6 and clks per bit = 163 fine at 9600 baud

yet, on the tapeout proj, all clocks must be external
max tapeout clk is about 12khz?
teletype is going to run.. off a 555 right?
N = 19 is about as low as fractional use of the logic analyzer can go

really do need more than 1 clock per bit or the rx isnt happy

as found N = 15, div = 8
want to test for 50 baud, lowest serial port setting?
N = 6 and clks per bit = 31296 fine at 50 baud?
10 and 1956 no
12 and 978 no
13 and 489 no
11 and 163 yes at 300 baud

using teletape reader?
14 and 135 lookin good! 45ish baud!

ascii out at 9600 not great when using div 6 clk with an external loopback cable..
slower clock needed for tapeout project

6 and 163 for 9600 works
10 and 163 for 600? works w internal loop.. works externally!!!! 97.640kHz ext clock
how low can it go?
97640/163=599.018
11 and 163 works at 300 baud into the pc and is really 299.509 baud soo... +/- a Hz ok

tty reading from tape reader is 23.0ms / bit.. 43.48Hz
tty reader with 1x clocks per bit... N=14 and 135 Clk/B, iClock = 6102Hz
6102/135 = 45.2 checks out
435/10 going to work? 435Hz / 10.... garbage
870/20 msotly garbled
1740/40 good! about 15/80 chars garbled
3480/80 better, 6/80 garbled
6960/160, 9/80... hm maybe output uart needs higher clock?

lowering output Uart from 19200clk & 2 div
set at: 4800 & 8, pc baud at 600... garbage
9600 and 16, pc at 600... garbled but there
with 'A' hardcoded in, there's just 1/80 in error
9600 / 1 ? every char an error
9600 / 2 every char an error
4 bad
/8? 1/80 bad
AH! skipping the external clk loopback wire helps a lot!
working well with minimal external loopback jumpers:
Baudot 6960 / 160
Ascii 9600 / 8

David's teletype model 28 is.. ITA2? has UK pound symbol, other notes:
h05 is ' and not BEL, ITA2 coding
h09 is $, US-TTY coding
h0B is BEL and not ', ITA2 coding
h11 is " US-TTY coding
h14 is uk pound, not #, ITA2 coding, and the teletpye has a key for it, that works, but no hammer!
h0D is #, there is no !

is working perfectly.. how about a round number for the rx uart?
4380 / 100 works perfectly! rad! ascii out at 9600 / 8

9600 / 1 works fine too for ascii out

how about 2175 / 50 and 4800 / 1 for some safety?
works! sticking to this
